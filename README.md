## Getting Started

Are you new here? Take a look at the [projects section](https://github.com/orgs/LaraCrafts/projects) and you might find something interesting to get involved with.

You might also want to take a look at each of the [existing packages](https://github.com/LaraCrafts) to gather a brighter idea of what you can be part of. Here is the list:

- [laravel-geo-routes](https://github.com/LaraCrafts/laravel-geo-routes): GeoLocation restricted routes for Laravel
- [laravel-chunk-uploader](https://github.com/LaraCrafts/laravel-chunk-uploader): Chunk Uploader Package For Laravel
- [laravel-url-shortener](https://github.com/LaraCrafts/laravel-url-shortener): Powerful URL shortening tools in Laravel

## Coding Standards

As of now we follow the [PSR-2: Coding Style Guide](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) when writing code, so please make sure to take a look at it before writing your first lines. However, as the industry moves to [PSR-12: Extended Coding Style](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/) at some point we will switch as well in the future.

## Packages

Package ideas can be discussed on slack in the **#packages-ideas** channel. For a package to be created, a majority of voters must agree to the idea and at least two team members (one _lead developer_ and one other maintainer) must accept to **continuously** work on it.

**The lead developer** (_aka_ lead maintainer) is whoever came up with the package idea and is responsible of creating a roadmap for the package and of the progress of the development in general.

**A package that has reached 3 months of inactivity will be automatically archived**, so if for any reasons the lead developer cannot proceed with the development they have to find a new lead before the 3 months deadline.

Every package must:

- Have a README.md and a [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/LaraCrafts/boilerplate/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) files.
- Have [StyleCI integration](https://github.com/LaraCrafts/boilerplate/blob/master/.styleci.yml)
- Have tests
- Have a continuous Integration (e.g. [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/), [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)...)
- Be linked to a project with the package name in order to keep things organized

To skip all of the overhead of creating the basic package files, you can use the [package boilerplate template](https://github.com/LaraCrafts/boilerplate) while creating a new repository.
